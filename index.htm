        <p style="color: white;">PUBG: Battlegrounds (PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds) is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed
             by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. In this game, up to 100 players land on a large map using parachutes and
              search for weapons, armor, and supplies to survive. As the match continues, the safe zone gradually shrinks,
               forcing players to move closer and fight each other. Players can choose to play solo, in pairs (duo), or in teams
                of four (squad). The main goal is to be the last player or team alive, which is celebrated as “Winner Winner
                 Chicken Dinner.” PUBG is known for its realistic graphics, strategic gameplay, and intense combat, and it is 
                 available on PC, consoles, and as PUBG Mobile, making it one of the most popular battle royale games worldwide</p>

                     it introduced a realistic and competitive survival style of gameplay that attracted millions of players. After 
                     its release, PUBG quickly gained global attention, especially among young gamers, due to its intense matches, 
                     teamwork-based play, and large open maps. The launch of PUBG Mobile further increased its popularity by making 
                     the game accessible to smartphone users, particularly in countries like India, China, and Southeast Asia. PUBG’s 
                     popularity is also boosted by its strong esports presence, regular updates, new maps, and seasonal events, which 
                     keep players engaged. Streaming platforms and gaming influencers have also played a major role in promoting PUBG,
                      helping it remain a well-known and widely played game even years after its release</p>
